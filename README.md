# note-map

Overview: Note Map is a user-friendly, map-based application that allows users to create and manage notes directly on a map interface. It utilizes JavaScript and the Leaflet library for mapping functionalities, with LocalStorage for note management.

# Technologies Used:
- JavaScript: Core functionality of the application.
- Leaflet: For map operations and interactions.
- LocalStorage: To store and manage user notes.

# Features:
- User Location Access: Users can share their location to center the map. If declined, the map defaults to Washington,D.C.
- Note Creation: Clicking on the map opens a form to enter a note's title, date, and status. Notes are saved in LocalStorage, and a cursor is placed at the note's location.
- Sidebar and Note Cards: Notes are displayed as cards in a collapsible sidebar. Each card includes:
- A Delete button to remove the note from LocalStorage.
- A Flight icon to focus the map on the note's location.
- This application enhances note-taking by integrating it with a visual mapping experience, making it easy for users to manage their notes based on geographical context.
